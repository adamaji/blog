Hi there, I'm Adam! I wanted to start writing to create a better understanding for myself of the things I'm learning and have yet to learn. I've learned a lot of things the past few years that are still fuzzy concepts in my head that I need to solidify in writing. I also want to practice putting my thoughts out into the ether. Expression is vital to communication and research, and frankly is something that I need to improve. To that end, I want to remind myself that the writing here doesn't have to be perfect.

You'll find stuff on here related to the fields I'm interested in (computer vision, language) and maybe occasionally some personal thoughts. If I make any mistakes feel free to let me know or [correct me][my-github]!
